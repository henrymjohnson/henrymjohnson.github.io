                    <h3>Classifying Movie Genres</h3>
                    <p>
                        Using a dataset of movie scripts scraped from IMSDB and genres detailed in MovieLens, I linked the movie titles and release years from the sources using a fuzzy match and built a supervised learning model to multi-label classifier to predict the genres of a movie based on its script. I used a variety of natural language processing techniques to extract features from the scripts, and then compared using a KNN and various OVR (Naïve Bayes, Linear with Stochastic Gradient Descent, and Logistic Regression with SVD-Transformed Texts) to predict the genres. After this, I compared the models and found that the OVR with Naïve Bayes tended to perform the best.
