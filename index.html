                    <h3>Classifying Movie Genres</h3>
                    <p>Using a dataset of movie scripts, I built a model to predict the genre of a movie based on its script. I used a variety of natural language processing techniques to extract features from the scripts, and then compared using a KNN and various OVR (Naïve Bayes, Linear with Stochastic Gradient Descent, and Logistic Regression with SVD-Transformed Texts) to predict the genres. After this, I compared the models and found that the OVR with Naïve Bayes tended to perform the best. <a href="https://henrymjohnson.github.io/notebooks/Predicting%20Movie%20Genres%20from%20Movie%20Scripts.html">Notebook</a>.</p>
